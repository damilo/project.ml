# Machine Learning Projects
Realized projects of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.
## General
There's one project per directory. Each project consists of a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) where all the work has been done. The final solution of a project is available in an HTML file (.html).
