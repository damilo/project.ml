# Machine Learning Projects
Realized projects of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.
## General
There's one project per directory. Each project consists of a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) where all the work has been done. The final solution of a project is available in an HTML file (.html).

### Predicting Boston Housing Prices
\- regression, grid search, cross-validation -

A modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Data and description can now be found on <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing'>Kaggle</a>.

### Finding Donors for CharityML
\- classification, supervised learning (Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, SVM), feature engineering (unskewing, normalization, one-hot encoding), feature selection -

Task: Predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000 per year based on census data

### Creating Customer Segments
\- classification, unsupervised learning (GMM, K-Means), statistics (distributions, correlations/heatmap), PCA -

Task: Describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with, to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

### Dog Breed Classifier
\- multi-class classification, neural networks (CNN), Haar Cascades, Transfer Learning -

Task: Predict if an image contains either a human or a dog. If it's a dog then output the dog breed.

### Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly
\- reinforcement learning (continuous/discrete spaces, Deep Q-Learning) -

Task: Teach a simulated quadcopter to fly up in the air.
