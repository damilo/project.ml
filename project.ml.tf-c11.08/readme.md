## Project: MLP MNIST
---
## Project Overview
Realization of exercise 8 in chapter 11, book 'Hands-On Machine Learning...' by Aurelien Geron

Build, train and evaluate a Deep Neural Network.

Task: Classify handwritten digits

Dataset: MNIST (60,000 training instances, 10,000 test instances)

## Subtasks
\- data preprocessing (min-max scaling)

\- dataset splitting into training, validation and test set

\- implement a class to construct, train and score a DNN (5 dense layers, ELU activation, He initialization)

\- hyperparameter tuning (grid search with stratified k-fold cross validation)

## Todo
\- batch normalization

\- apply regularization methods (i.e. dropouts)

\- transfer learning
